#' @title A Swiss-Army Knife for Data I/O
#' @description The aim of rio is to make data file I/O in R as easy as possible. \code{\link{export}} and \code{\link{import}} serve as a Swiss-army knife for painless data I/O for data from almost any file format by inferring the data structure from the file extension, natively reading web-based data sources, setting reasonable defaults for import and export, and relying on efficient data import and export packages. An additional convenience function, \code{\link{convert}}, provides a simple method for converting between file types.
#' \href{https://github.com/Stan125/GREA}{GREA} provides an RStudio add-in to import data using rio.
