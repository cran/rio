\title{A Swiss-army knife for data I/O}
\description{The aim of rio is to make data file I/O in R as easy as possible. The \code{export} and \code{import} serve as a Swiss-army knife for painless data I/O for data from almost any file format by inferring the data structure from the file extension, natively reading web-based data sources, setting reasonable defaults for import and export, and relying on efficient data import and export packages.}
